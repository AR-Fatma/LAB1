1. - Uses less memory as there is no equivalent information stored
- Allows users to have a single class file for the information
- Reduces margin of error with a user manually converting the data
- Provides flexibility with applications of use


2. -There is a potential of a loss of accuracy with values, as several repeated computations can lose decimal values to fit within the allocated number of bits in the variables


3. checkAccuracy(x, y){
